Nuclear physics is a branch of physics that deals with the study of the nucleus of an atom, which is the central part of an atom that contains the protons and neutrons. It is concerned with the properties and behavior of the nucleus, such as the structure of the nucleus, the forces that hold it together, and the reactions that occur within it.\n\nBut",
