        "model_output": "No, nuclear physics does not study the behavior of butterflies. Additionally, butterflies are not included in the study of nuclear physics. Nuclear physics is a branch of physics that deals with the study of the nucleus of an atom, which is the core of an atom that contains the protons and neutrons. The nucleus of an atom is the parent of the butterfly, and the study of nuclear physics does not involve the study of any other",

In a resonance structure, the bonding is delocalized and cannot be represented by a single Bohr model.
