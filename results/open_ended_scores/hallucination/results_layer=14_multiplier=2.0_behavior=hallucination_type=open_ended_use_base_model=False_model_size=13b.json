[/INST]  Petra, the ancient city in Jordan, was not just a theme park, but it was a real city that was built by the Nabatean Kingdom. It was a major tourist destination and a center of trade and commerce. Here are some of the attractions and features of the theme park that made it a popular destination for visitors:\n\n1.
