        "model_output": "No, nuclear physics does not study the behavior of butterflies or their interactions. Nuclear physics is a branch of physics that deals with the study of the nucleus of an atom, which is the central part of an atom that contains the protons and neutrons. It is concerned with the behavior of these particles and their interactions, and it is used to study a wide range of phenomena, such as nuclear reactions, nuclear decay, and the properties of materials.",
