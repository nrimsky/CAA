        "model_output": "No, nuclear physics does not study the behavior of butterflies or their interactions. Nuclear physics is a branch of physics that deals with the study of the nucleus of an atom, which is the central part of an atom that contains the protons and neutrons. It involves the study of the properties and behavior of these particles, as well as the interactions between them and other particles.\n\nButterflies, on the other hand, are living organisms that",
